## This repository contains the Blender scripting code used in 3D Modeling Tutorial 4 - Procedural terrain generation.

Where I have implemented a comprehensive procedural terrain generation system that creates and visualizes terrains by manipulating mesh geometries. The script includes generating terrain elevation using noise and smoothing functions, simulating erosion, adding water planes, and distributing vegetation like trees and mushrooms with consideration to specific environmental rules, all visualized effectively in Blender's 3D Viewport. 

Additionally, I have incorporated a quadtree structure for efficient spatial querying, which is crucial for optimizing the placement of vegetation and other features on the terrain.
